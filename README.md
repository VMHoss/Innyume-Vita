# Innyume-Vita
A horror shitpost game, now ported to Vita.

This game was decompiled, and ported to Vita using uTinyRipper, DnSpy and Unity 2018.2.9f1. Make sure that you are using this version of Unity to ensure maximum compatibility.

Currently, the game has problems keeping the framerate consistent due to realtime lights. You can fix this by baking lights.
